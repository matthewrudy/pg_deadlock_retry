Postgres Deadlock Retry
==============

Based on the original "Deadlock Retry" plugin
I aim to make this work in Postgres too.

But here is the original README below.

Deadlock Retry
==============

Deadlock retry allows the database adapter (currently only tested with the
MySQLAdapter) to retry transactions that fall into deadlock. It will retry
such transactions three times before finally failing.

This capability is automatically added to ActiveRecord. No code changes or otherwise are required.
